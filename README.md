This project is meant to be an exploration into machine learning. The goal was to take a dataset, in this case one containing weather information from Washington D.C., and create three different machine learning models: KNeighborsClassifier, GaussianNB, and a DecisionTreeClassifier. After initializing and training these models we then tested the models on validation data to recieve scores of how accurate the model is. After picking a best model based on the scores, we used that model on the testing data to see how it performed.
